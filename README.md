# Hybrid_Mac_Coder_Keyboard_Layout

This is a collection (of one) Hybrid Mac Keyboard layouts to allow more confortable use of US-centric keyboard shortcuts when coding. _At the moment only Swiss French keyboard exists._

## How it works

It starts like a Swiss French Keyboard except _{} [] ;'\,./_ keys on the rights are easy to access just like on US keyboards instead of accented characters usually there. You only need to turn on Caps lock to get access to my european accents for when you need to talk to people instead of an IDE. The Z and Y are still in the same QWERTZ position because I see no advantage in switching to just confuse my Command+Z usage.

You're always one key away from writing either french poetry or code.

Some keys are intentionally duplicated because I always mixed them up switching from US to Swiss QWERTZ keyboard, so I decided the solution was to fix the keyboard, not me.

For example, if I type : or : it always work because I have the key both on the Swiss and US position. Now NeoVIM just always works even if I am doing it wrong. I did leave the $ in place in Swiss mode because I can't sacrifice my shift+C to write en Fran*รง*ais. And could not find a way to make just this switch when Caps Lock is ON.

## INSTALLING

Copy this .keylayout file in your home directory in "~/Library/Keyboard Layouts" and select it from "Others" in the input sources in Preferences. Sometimes you may need to logout or even reboot for the system to notice an update in there.

## (1) WORK IN PROGRESS

Look, this isn't perfect but I thought it may be useful for others so I welcome your remarks. There are somethings I couldn't fix so really there is room for improvement.
