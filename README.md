# Hybrid_Mac_Coder_Keyboard_Layout

This is a collection (of one) Hybrid Mac Keyboard layouts to allow more confortable use of US-centric keyboard shortcuts when coding. _At the moment only Swiss French keyboard exists._

## How it works : Code Mode & Swiss Mode

Essentially it starts in _code mode_ which is like a Swiss French Keyboard except _{} [] ;'\,./_ keys on the right are easy to access just like on US keyboards instead of accented characters. You only need to turn on _Caps lock_ to get access to your latin/german accents for when you need to talk to people instead of an IDE.

You're always one key away from writing either french poetry or code.

Some keys are intentionally duplicated because I always mixed them up switching from US to Swiss QWERTZ keyboard, so I decided the solution was to fix the keyboard, not me.

- _:_ For example, if I type : or ; it always works because I have the keys both on the Swiss and US positions. Now NeoVIM just always works even if I am doing it wrong. Can't stress how _unfrustrating_ this is for me!

- _$_ I did leave the $ in the Swiss location in Code mode because I can't sacrifice my shift+4 to write en Fran*ç*ais and could not find a way to make just this switch between _$_ and _ç_ when Caps Lock is ON. You can also press Option+\ in Code mode to use it without switching to Swiss mode (Caps lock is slower for just one key).

- The _Z_ and _Y_ are still in the same QWERTZ position in both modes because I see no advantage in switching to just confuse my Command+Z usage. This was one of my top motivations to find a way to stop switching from QWERTZ to QWERTY.

- alt + o / a / n produce _õÕ_, _ã_ _Ã_, _ñ_ _Ñ_ - I need this to type in Spanish & Portuguese. It's not the standard way on a swiss keyboard (you're supposed to use ~ + the letter) but it'll make my life easier.

## INSTALLING

Copy this .keylayout file in your home directory in "~/Library/Keyboard Layouts" and select it from "Others" in the input sources in Preferences. Sometimes you may need to logout or even reboot for the system to notice an update in there.

## (1) WORK IN PROGRESS

Look, this isn't perfect but I thought it may be useful for others so I welcome your remarks. There are somethings I couldn't fix so really there is room for improvement.
