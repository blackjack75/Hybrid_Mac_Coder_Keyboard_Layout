# Hybrid_Mac_Coder_Keyboard_Layout

This is a collection (currently of one) Hybrid Mac Keyboard layouts to allow more confortable use of US-centric keyboard shortcuts when coding. _At the moment only my version exists. The previous version was closer to a Swiss French QWERTZ keyboard but the latest version switched to full QWERTY because I didn't want to switch Z and Y constantly._

This is a work in progress. I adapt it regularly to match *my* writing habits. Which means someone who has used painfully a Swiss French keyboard for years and regularly switched to US QWERTY for code and terminal commands. It's probably not the right thing for you unless you were born in Switzerland, moved to Brazil and like to write code.

# How it works : Code Mode & Latin (mainly French/Spanish/Portuguese) Mode

Essentially it starts in _code mode_ which is *NEARLY*e a US QWERTY keyboard with  _{} [] ;'\,./_ keys on the right and special signs on the top line above numbers being also ~ !@#$%^&*() . You only need to turn on _Caps lock_ to get access to your latin accents for when you need to talk to people instead of an IDE. I said nearly because some keys are in position of both a swiss and american keys. At least at least I stop mistaking both.

Other than that. You're always one key away from writing either french poetry or code.

- _:_ For example, if I type : or ; it always works because I have the keys both on the Swiss and US positions. Now NeoVIM just always works even if I am doing it wrong. Can't stress how _unfrustrating_ this is for me!

- alt + o / a / n produce _õÕ_, _ã_ _Ã_, _ñ_ _Ñ_ - I need this to type in Spanish & Portuguese. It's not the standard way on a swiss keyboard (you're supposed to use ~ + the letter) but it'll make my life easier.

## INSTALLING

Copy this .keylayout file in your home directory in "~/Library/Keyboard Layouts" and select it from "Others" in the input sources in Preferences. Sometimes you may need to logout or even reboot for the system to notice an update in there.

## (1) WORK IN PROGRESS

Look, this isn't perfect but I thought it may be useful for others so I welcome your remarks. There are somethings I couldn't fix so really there is room for improvement.
